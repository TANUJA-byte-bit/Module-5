# 5e) Arithmetic Operations Using Multiple Inheritance in Python

This Python program demonstrates **multiple inheritance** by performing basic arithmetic operations — Addition, Subtraction, and Division — using three classes.

##  Aim

To write a Python program to calculate **Add, Sub & Division** using **Multiple Inheritance**.

##  Algorithm

1. **Define `Calculation1` class**
   - Contains `Summation(a, b)` method to return the sum of two numbers.
2. **Define `Calculation2` class**
   - Contains `Subtraction(a, b)` method to return the difference of two numbers.
3. **Define `Derived` class**
   - Inherits from both `Calculation1` and `Calculation2`.
   - Contains `Division(a, b)` method to return the division result.
4. **Input**
   - Prompt the user to enter two numbers.
5. **Process**
   - Create an object of the `Derived` class.
   - Call `Summation`, `Subtraction`, and `Division` methods.
6. **Output**
   - Display the results of the three operations.

##  Program 
```
class addition:
    def add(self,a,b):
        return a+b
class subtraction:
    def sub(self,a,b):
        return a-b
class division:
    def div(self,a,b):
        return a/b
class calculator(addition,subtraction,division):
    pass
a=int(input())
b=int(input())
calc=calculator()
print(calc.add(a,b))
print(calc.sub(a,b))
print(calc.div(a,b))
```
